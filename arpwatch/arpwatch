# when using systemd you have to enable arpwatch explicitly for each interface
# you want to run it on by running:
systemctl enable arpwatch@eth1
systemctl start arpwatch@eth1
systemctl enable arpwatch@eth2
systemctl start arpwatch@eth2
systemctl enable arpwatch@eth3
systemctl start arpwatch@eth3
systemctl enable arpwatch@lo
systemctl start arpwatch@lo

# For the LSB init script, enter a list of interfaces into the list below;
# arpwatch will be started to listen on these interfaces.
# Note: This is ignored when using systemd!
# INTERFACES="eth0 eth1"
INTERFACES="eth1 eth2 eth3 lo"
